# Elite Elementor Addons

**Premium Elementor widgets for high-end industrial designs.**

## Description

This plugin provides a suite of custom Elementor widgets designed to bridge the gap between complex custom HTML/CSS animations and the ease of use of Elementor's visual editor. It was built specifically for the **CPS-LDA V3** migration but is structured to be reusable for future "Elite" projects.

## Widgets

### 1. Elite Service Card

A fully editable service card with:

- **Glassmorphism Styling**: Frosted glass effects and golden accents.
- **Hover Interactions**: Zoom, glow, and tilt effects.
- **Staggered Animations**: Native controls for entrance delays.
- **Dynamic Content**: Icon, Title, Description, and Background Image controls.

### 2. Elite Section Header (Coming Soon)

Standardized section headers with watermark text.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository into `wp-content/plugins/elite-elementor-addons`.
2. Activate the plugin via WordPress Admin.
3. Find the widgets under the **"Elite Addons"** category in Elementor.
